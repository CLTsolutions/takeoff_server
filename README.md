# Welcome to Takeoff!

This is the server side of a PERN stack full CRUD [traveler's app](https://github.com/CLTsolutions/takeoff_client) in which users can track trips they have taken and blog about their experiences. This server follows the MVC pattern and uses Postgres as the database management system.

## Project Requirements
This server was completed during my final badge of Eleven Fifty Academy's web development cohort. It displays my understanding of the following:
- PostgreSQL
- Express
- Node
- REST APIs
- Creating API Endpoints
- React Basics
- Connecting Server and Client
